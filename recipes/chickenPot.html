    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 prepared pie crusts (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced chicken and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, diced carrots, diced celery, and minced garlic. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables in the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooked chicken, frozen peas, frozen corn, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Place one pie crust in the bottom of the greased pie dish. Pour the chicken mixture over the crust.</li>
        <li>Top with the second pie crust, crimping the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
