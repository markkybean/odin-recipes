    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta or bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, minced garlic, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the rendered fat. Toss to coat the spaghetti with the fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti, stirring continuously to coat the pasta evenly. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooked pancetta or bacon until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Season the spaghetti carbonara with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide the spaghetti carbonara among serving plates, garnish with chopped fresh parsley, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
